Here is **Module 12 — Dashboard**, written in the same **condensed, Notion‑friendly format** as Modules 9 and 11.

It is clean, cockpit‑aligned, and includes the new ?‑markers, Help Peek, Settings Peek, and AI‑context model.

---

# **MODULE 12 — DASHBOARD (CONDENSED VERSION)**

## **12.1 Purpose**

Dashboard is the system’s **high‑level command surface**, giving a unified view across:

- Projects
- Connect (campaigns, emails, social, blog)
- Timeline
- Workspace
- Files
- Map
- Automations
- Analytics

It is not a reporting page — it is a **live cockpit** that updates based on context, filters, and user focus.

---

## **12.2 Layout**

**Desktop:** Sidebar → Header → Dashboard Panels → Right Panel (optional)

**Mobile:** Header → Panels → Bottom bar → Sheets for detail views

Panels are modular blocks that can be rearranged, resized, or hidden.

---

## **12.3 Panel Types**

- **My Day** — tasks, deadlines, reminders
- **Projects Overview** — status, milestones, progress
- **Campaign Overview** — active campaigns, steps, performance
- **Content Calendar** — upcoming emails, social posts, blog posts
- **Timeline Snapshot** — today + next 7 days
- **Automations** — running, paused, errors
- **Analytics** — opens, clicks, engagement, conversions
- **Files & Workspace** — recent items, drafts, shared docs
- **Map Activity** — recent locations, tagged items
- **Notifications** — mentions, approvals, comments

Each panel is a card with identity + metadata.

---

## **12.4 Panel Interactions**

- Click panel → expands into right panel
- Drag to reorder
- Resize (S / M / L / XL)
- Collapse/expand
- Filter per panel
- Pin important panels to top

Panels behave like mini‑dashboards inside the main dashboard.

---

## **12.5 Filters & Context**

Dashboard filters appear in the left rail:

- by project
- by campaign
- by date range
- by channel (email, social, blog)
- by status
- by priority
- by assignee

Filters update all panels simultaneously.

---

## **12.6 Card Identity**

Dashboard panels use the same identity system:

- photostrip
- fit modes
- rounded‑top mask
- show/hide on front/back
- card‑front templates

---

## **12.7 Metadata**

Panels can show:

- counts
- percentages
- progress bars
- charts
- lists
- timelines
- mini‑calendars
- activity feeds

Metadata is collapsible.

---

## **12.8 Actions**

- open item
- filter
- summarise
- extract tasks
- generate insights
- link to project
- link to campaign
- delete panel (hide)

---

## **12.9 Preview/Editor (for expanded panels)**

When a panel is expanded into the right panel:

- shows full detail view
- supports inline editing
- supports linked items
- supports inline media

Modes: collapsed, normal, full‑page, full‑screen.

---

## **12.10 Interactive Media**

Supports:

- Peek
- Gallery context
- Select for gallery
- Add to photostrip
- Replace card image
- Fit modes
- View on map

---

## **12.11 Dashboard‑Specific Behaviours**

- **Auto‑refresh:** panels update in real time
- **Cross‑panel linking:** selecting an item highlights it across panels
- **Smart surfacing:** important items bubble up automatically
- **Focus mode:** hides all but the selected panel
- **AI insights:** Oscar can generate summaries, risks, opportunities

---

## **12.12 ?‑Markers in Panels**

Every panel supports **? markers**:

- next to metrics
- next to charts
- next to filters
- next to configuration options

Clicking ? opens a **Help Peek** with:

- context‑aware questions
- short explanation
- link to documentation/templates

Oscar receives exact panel + metric context.

---

## **12.13 Settings Peek (Dashboard Settings)**

Settings Peek includes:

- panel layout
- panel visibility
- default filters
- refresh behaviour
- density (compact / normal / spacious)
- colour coding
- chart styles

Each setting row includes:

- label
- input
- **? icon**
- status

---

## **12.14 Inbox Peek + Share‑to‑Oscar**

If a panel relates to an integration (e.g., analytics, campaigns):

Oscar can ask:

> “Do you have a setup/welcome email for this provider?”
> 

Inbox Peek opens with filtered emails.

Each email has **Share to Oscar**.

Sharing fills settings automatically.

---

## **12.15 AI Context Model**

Oscar always knows:

- which panel
- which metric
- which filter
- which block in the expanded view
- which Peek (Settings, Help, Inbox)

Oscar can:

- generate insights
- summarise dashboards
- detect anomalies
- propose actions
- rewrite descriptions
- align dashboard with project/campaign goals
