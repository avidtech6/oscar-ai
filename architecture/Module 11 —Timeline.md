# **MODULE 11 — TIMELINE (CONDENSED VERSION)**

## **11.1 Purpose**

Timeline is the system’s **time‑based intelligence layer**, used to visualise, schedule, and coordinate:

- tasks
- milestones
- events
- project phases
- campaign steps
- automation triggers
- content schedules (email, social, blog)
- deadlines
- reminders

It is not a calendar replacement — it is a **contextual timeline** tied to Projects, Connect, and Workspace.

---

## **11.2 Layout**

**Desktop:** Sidebar → Header → Timeline Canvas → Right Panel

**Mobile:** Header → Timeline → Bottom bar → Sheets for items

Timeline Canvas = horizontal or vertical scrollable timeline.

Right panel = back of card for selected item.

---

## **11.3 Timeline Item Types**

All timeline items are cards:

- Task
- Milestone
- Project section
- Deliverable
- Campaign step
- Email send
- Social post
- Blog publish
- Automation trigger
- Event
- Reminder

Each item inherits metadata + identity from its parent domain.

---

## **11.4 Timeline Views**

- **Horizontal timeline** (default)
- **Vertical timeline**
- **Calendar grid** (optional)
- **Gantt‑style** (sections + tasks)
- **Campaign timeline** (Connect)
- **Project timeline** (Projects)

Switching views does not change data — only presentation.

---

## **11.5 Grouping & Filtering**

- by project
- by campaign
- by item type
- by status
- by priority
- by assignee
- by due date
- by channel (email, social, blog)

Filters appear in the left rail.

---

## **11.6 Card Identity**

Timeline items use the same identity system:

- photostrip
- fit modes
- rounded‑top mask
- show/hide on front/back
- card‑front templates

---

## **11.7 Interaction Model**

- Click item → opens in right panel
- Drag to move date
- Drag edges to change duration
- Multi‑select for batch edits
- Snap‑to milestones
- Snap‑to campaign steps
- Inline add: click empty space to create new item

---

Timeline items support:

- start date

## **11.12 Timeline‑Specific Behaviours**

---

## **11.13 ?‑Markers in Timeline Items**

Every timeline item’s editor supports **? markers**:

- headings
- paragraphs
- lists
- tables
- galleries
- embedded media

Clicking ? opens a **Help Peek** with:

- context‑aware questions
- short explanation
- link to templates or documentation

Oscar receives exact block context.

---

## **11.14 Settings Peek (Timeline Settings)**

Settings Peek includes:

- default view (horizontal, vertical, Gantt)
- working hours
- working days
- auto‑rollup rules
- dependency rules
- conflict detection rules
- colour coding
- timeline density

Each setting row includes:

- label
- input
- **? icon**
- status

---

## **11.15 Inbox Peek + Share‑to‑Oscar**

If a timeline item relates to an integration (e.g., campaign schedule, automation trigger):

Oscar can ask:

> “Do you have a setup/welcome email for this provider?”
> 

Inbox Peek opens with filtered emails.

Each email has **Share to Oscar**.

Sharing fills settings automatically.

---

## **11.16 AI Context Model**

Oscar always knows:

- which timeline view
- which item
- which date range
- which block in the editor
- which Peek (Settings, Help, Inbox)

Oscar can:

- generate tasks
- adjust schedules
- detect conflicts
- propose dependencies
- summarise timelines
- rewrite descriptions
- generate campaign schedules
- align project + campaign timelines
