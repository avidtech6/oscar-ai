# **MODULE 15 — SEARCH & INDEXING (CONDENSED VERSION)**

## **15.1 Purpose**

Search & Indexing is the system’s **unified retrieval layer**, enabling fast, context‑aware discovery across:

- Files
- Workspace documents
- Projects
- Connect (emails, social, blog, campaigns)
- Timeline items
- Dashboard panels
- Map locations
- Conversations
- Integrations
- Activity feed

It ensures the user can find anything instantly, with Oscar enhancing results through context and intent understanding.

## **15.2 Search Entry Points**

Search can be triggered from:

- Global search bar (header)
- Sidebar search
- Ask Oscar (natural language queries)
- Inline search inside editors
- Filters in left rail
- Map search

All entry points feed into the same indexing engine.

## **15.9 ?‑Markers in Search**

Search results and filters support **? markers**:

- next to filters

Clicking ? opens a **Help Peek** with:

Oscar receives exact search context.

## **15.10 Settings Peek (Search Settings)**

## **15.11 Inbox Peek + Share‑to‑Oscar**

If search relates to integrations (e.g., “Brevo API key”, “SMTP settings”):

Oscar can ask:

> “Do you have a setup/welcome email for this provider?”
> 

Inbox Peek opens with filtered emails.

Each email has **Share to Oscar**.

Sharing fills settings automatically.

---

## **15.12 AI Context Model**

Oscar always knows:

- which search mode is active
- which filters are applied
- which domain is in focus
- which result is selected
- which Peek (Settings, Help, Inbox) is open

Oscar can:

- refine queries
- propose filters
- summarise results
- detect missing items
- generate related searches
- link results to projects/campaigns
- answer questions directly
