### 1.2 Scope of Survey
The survey includes all trees within the site boundary and those off-site whose Root Protection Areas (RPAs) may be affected by proposed development.

### 1.3 Limitations
- This is a preliminary tree survey (Phase 1)
- No invasive soil excavations or climbing inspections were carried out
- Trees have been assessed from ground level only

## 2. Survey Methodology

### 2.1 Tree Assessment
Each tree was assessed for:

- **Species:** Common name and scientific name
- **Height:** Estimated in metres
- **Stem Diameter:** Measured at 1.5m above ground level (or as specified)
- **Crown Spread:** Measured at cardinal points (N, E, S, W)
- **Crown Clearance:** Height of crown above ground level
- **Age Class:** Young / Semi-mature / Mature / Over-mature / Veteran
- **Condition:** Physical condition (good, fair, poor, dead)
- **Structural Condition:** Assessment of defects and management requirements

### 2.2 Category Grading
Trees are graded in accordance with BS5837:2012:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **A** | High quality and value - retention desirable |
| **B** | Moderate quality and value - retention desirable |
| **C** | Low quality and value - retention acceptable |
| **U** | Unsuitable for retention |
