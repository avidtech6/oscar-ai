📘 PHASE 0 — MASTER VISION DOCUMENT FOR THE OSCAR AI COPILOT LAYER
The Intelligence Layer of the Workspace: Subtle, Aware, Helpful, and Always Present
⭐ INTRODUCTION
Oscar AI is not “an app with AI features.”
Oscar AI is a workspace with an intelligence layer woven through every surface.

The Copilot layer is the system that:

Watches what the user is doing

Understands the context

Offers subtle, optional help

Reacts instantly to new content

Edits documents, notes, reports, and blog posts

Handles images, diagrams, and voice notes

Stores contextual chat history

Switches between chat mode and context mode

Lives everywhere, but never intrudes

This document defines the vision, principles, architecture, and behaviour of the Copilot layer.

It is the foundation for all subsequent phases.

⭐ 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY
Oscar AI must feel:

Subtle — never intrusive

Powerful — always capable

Aware — understands context

Respectful — user stays in control

Predictable — consistent behaviour

Flexible — works across all pages

Human‑centred — enhances manual editing, never replaces it

The assistant should feel like:

“The app is working with me, not for me.”

⭐ 2. THE COPILOT LAYER
The Copilot layer is made of three subsystems:

A. The Brain (Phase 21)
Global assistant bar

Context chips

Smart hints

Micro‑cues

Chat Mode vs Context Mode

Modal‑attached assistant

Contextual chat history

Maximise → filtered chat

Multi‑select AI actions

Event model

B. The Senses (Phase 22)
Image ingestion

Diagram understanding

Gallery system

Voice notes

Transcription

Media‑aware AI actions

Media‑aware nudges

C. The Hands (Phase 23+)
Layout engine

Section generation

Rewriting

Summaries

Insertions

Reordering

Table generation

Diagram labelling

Multi‑document workflows

Together, these form the Oscar AI Copilot OS.

⭐ 3. THE GLOBAL ASSISTANT
The assistant is:

Always visible

Always available

Always context‑aware

Always collapsible

Always respectful

Desktop:
Bottom bar

Expandable panel

Maximise button

Mobile:
Thin bottom bar

Full‑screen panel

The assistant is the primary interaction layer.

⭐ 4. CONTEXT AWARENESS
The assistant must always know:

What page the user is on

What item is open

What items are selected

Whether a modal is open

Whether the user is editing

Whether the user is chatting

Whether new media was added

Whether the user changed context

This is powered by a global context store.

⭐ 5. CHAT MODE VS CONTEXT MODE
Context Mode
Editing a note/report/blog/task

AI actions apply directly

Context chips visible

Smart hints relevant

Chat Mode
Triggered when user asks a general question.

Behaviour:

Page slides into background

Chat window becomes primary

Assistant answers normally

After conversation:

“Apply this to the document we were working on?”

If yes → content inserted
If no → stays in chat only

⭐ 6. MEDIA INTELLIGENCE
Oscar AI must understand:

Images

Diagrams

Screenshots

Camera photos

Voice notes

Audio recordings

Media is:

Saved to Gallery

Auto‑tagged

Available for AI actions

Triggering nudges

AI can:

Insert images

Place images side‑by‑side

Label diagrams

Transcribe audio

Insert transcriptions

Replace images

Move images

⭐ 7. NUDGE SYSTEM
Nudges are:

Optional

Subtle

Context‑aware

Triggered by events

Examples:

“Insert this image into the report?”

“Transcribe this voice note?”

“Rewrite this section?”

“Mark selected tasks as done?”

Nudges appear as:

Micro‑cue (!)

Small bubble above assistant bar

⭐ 8. CONTEXTUAL CHAT HISTORY
Rules:

Stored per item

Hidden by default

Only shown when user asks

Maximise button opens filtered chat

Clearly labelled

Colour‑coded

Inside the item:

Only one AI bubble appears
(“Content added.”)

⭐ 9. MULTI‑SELECT AI ACTIONS
Supported on:

Tasks

Notes

Projects

Reports

Blog posts

Examples:

“Mark all selected tasks as done”

“Tag selected notes as BS5837”

“Generate a combined report”

⭐ 10. PROMPT BOX DESIGN
Every prompt box includes:

📷 Camera

🎤 Microphone

🎙 Voice note

📎 File upload

💡 Smart hint line

🔍 Context chips

⬆️ Maximise button

⭐ 11. MODAL‑ATTACHED ASSISTANT
When editing in a modal:

Assistant attaches inside modal

Sticks to bottom

Context chips show item

Smart hints adapt

AI actions apply only to that item

⭐ 12. ONE‑BUBBLE CONFIRMATION RULE
When AI applies content:

Only one bubble appears

No chat history

No clutter

⭐ 13. EVENT MODEL
Assistant listens for:

Page changes

Item open/close

Selection changes

Media added

Voice note added

Modal open/close

Paste events

Assistant emits:

Insert content

Rewrite content

Insert media

Replace media

Label diagrams

Nudges

⭐ 14. USER CONTROL
The user can always:

Edit manually

Resize images

Move content

Undo/redo

Reject nudges

Decline “apply this?” prompts

Collapse assistant

Switch to chat mode

Filter chat history

AI never overrides manual editing.
