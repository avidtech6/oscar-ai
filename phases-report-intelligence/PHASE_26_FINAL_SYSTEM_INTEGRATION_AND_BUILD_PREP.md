📘 PHASE 26 — FINAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION & BUILD PREPARATION
Unifying All 25 Intelligence Phases Into a Single Coherent Copilot OS
⭐ OVERVIEW
Phase 26 is the final consolidation phase before full implementation.

Its purpose is to:

Integrate all 25 intelligence subsystems

Resolve overlaps

Ensure consistent behaviour

Validate cross‑system flows

Produce a unified architecture

Generate a final build plan

Prepare Roo for implementation

This phase ensures Oscar AI behaves like a single, coherent intelligence layer.

⭐ 1. UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE CONSOLIDATION
Combine:

Report intelligence stack (Phases 1–16)

Cross‑system intelligence (17–20)

Copilot OS (21–25)

Into a single architecture document.

Must include:

Component map

Data flow map

Event model

Context engine

Media pipeline

Layout engine

Document intelligence

Workflow intelligence

CRDT + Supabase sync

Undo/redo model

Error handling

⭐ 2. CROSS‑SYSTEM INTEGRATION TESTING
Test interactions between:

Media → Layout

Layout → Document intelligence

Document intelligence → Workflow intelligence

Workflow intelligence → Tasks/Projects

Chat mode ↔ Context mode

Modal assistant ↔ Global assistant

CRDT sync ↔ AI edits

Supabase ↔ Local state

⭐ 3. UX CONSISTENCY PASS
Ensure:

Assistant behaviour is consistent across pages

Context chips always correct

Smart hints always relevant

Micro‑cues always accurate

Modal assistant always scoped

One‑bubble confirmation always used

Chat history filtering always correct

⭐ 4. PERFORMANCE & STABILITY PASS
Test:

Large documents

Many images

Many voice notes

Many tasks

Many projects

Real‑time collaboration

Offline mode

Sync conflicts

Undo/redo across AI actions

⭐ 5. FINAL SPEC FOR ROO
Produce:

Final architecture

Final component list

Final data models

Final event model

Final build order

Final dependency graph

Final testing plan

Final UX rules

Final AI behaviour rules

This becomes the master build document.

⭐ 6. COMPLETION CRITERIA
Phase 26 is complete when:

All 25 phases are integrated

All cross‑system flows validated

All UX behaviours consistent

All AI behaviours consistent

All data models unified

All event models unified

All performance tests passed

Final build spec produced

Roo can begin implementation
